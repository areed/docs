A good use case for using the VendorAPI is license maintenance. In this example we want to find all licenses that are expiring soon (<5 days) in the unstable channel and extend them by a month. We are using our unstable channel to ship new features to some of our customers and want to extend their access to the channel by a month while we hammer out some bugs in this release.

## Prerequisites

You should already have an API Token set to Read/Write via the vendor site, and you should know the target App ID and Channel ID. For details on how to get the App ID and Channel ID programmatically, check out the document called [Finding Your API Token and App ID](/kb/developer-resources/finding-your-api-token-and-app-id). These values will not change and should be supplied as static values to your license updating script.

### 1) Get all outstanding licenses

First we will get all the licenses that have been issued for a specific app:

    curl -X GET \
    	 -H 'Authorization: <YOUR-API-TOKEN>' \
    	 https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v2/app/<YOUR-APP-ID>/licenses

Note, the result will contains an array of objects for all the licenses associated with this app, including all the channels.

### 2) Find expiring licenses

In my language of choice I am going to iterate through the returned array from step 1 and create a new array that contains all licenses where "ChannelId" fields match my Unstable Channel ID. I am then going to iterate through the new array and look for licenses with an "ExpireDate" that is within the next five days and pop those from this array.

### 3) Update expiring licenses

I am going to loop through the newly created array of expiring licenses from the previous step and update each of the licenses with a date that is 30 days from now. Its important to note that the field name to update on this endpoint is "expiration_date" and that I have to pass all of the expected fields from my license object because they will be overwritten with default values if they are left blank.

      curl -X PUT \
      	 -H 'Authorization: <YOUR-API-TOKEN>' \
      	 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      	 https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v2/license/<YOUR-LICENSE-ID> \
      	 -d '{"license_type":"not-set",
              "activation_email": false,
              "airgap_download_enabled": false,
              "assignee":"My-App",
              "update_policy":"manual",
              "channel_id":"<YOUR-CHANNEL-ID>",
              "expiration_date":"2018-03-13",
              "expiration_policy":"ignore",
              "require_activation":false}'

API license maintenance and management is one of the most powerful features of Replicated. To improve security, take a look at setting up two factor authentication by using Replicatedâ€™s Vendor Web portal which is a front-end UI for the Vendor API.
